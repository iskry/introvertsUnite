# introvertsUnite

## Description
Introverts Unite is a social media platform designed for introverted individuals to connect and share their thoughts and experiences. The application is built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose. Users can create a profile, make posts, and interact with other users through comments and reactions. The platform focuses on providing a safe space for introverted individuals to socialize and connect with like-minded people. Throughout the development process, I gained experience building a full-stack application using modern web technologies such as Node.js and MongoDB.
